# Programacion
 AI_GeneticAlgorithms, is a program that applies evolutionary techniques to generate optimized class timetables.  
It implements a genetic algorithm with tournament and roulette-wheel selection, one-point crossover, and mutation operators.  
The program produces valid schedules under constraints such as number of classes, duration, and time availability.
